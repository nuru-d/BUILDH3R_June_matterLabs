# Build smart contract
This educational experience laid a solid foundation in Ethereum smart contract creation, deployment, and interaction. Practical tasks and GitHub documentation allowed me to gain practical experience and compile a demonstrative portfolio. I became proficient in creating ERC20 tokens, managing hashed messages on the blockchain, and automating interactions with smart contracts via ethers.js. Moreover, I investigated zkSync and paymasters for handling transaction fees and managing token balances.
